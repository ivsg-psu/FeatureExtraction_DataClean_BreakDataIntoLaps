%% Introduction to and Purpose of the Code
% This is the explanation of the code that can be found by running
%       script_demo_Laps.m
% This is a script to demonstrate the functions within the Laps code
% library. This code repo is typically located at:
%   https://github.com/ivsg-psu/FeatureExtraction_DataClean_BreakDataIntoLaps
%
% If you have questions or comments, please contact Sean Brennan at
% sbrennan@psu.edu
%
% The purpose of the code is to break data into "laps", namely portions of
% data defined by start and end points, and in some cases, even allowing
% excursion points that must be "hit" between start and end points. The
% reason for this code is that it is very common that data collection in
% the field passes repeatedly over a test area, even in one data set, and
% thus one must be able to quickly break the code into individual data
% groups with one grouping, or "lap", per traversal.

%% Dependencies and Setup of the Code
% The code requires several other libraries to work, namely the following
%%
% 
% * DebugTools - the repo can be found at: https://github.com/ivsg-psu/Errata_Tutorials_DebugTools
% * PathClassLibrary - the repo can be found at: https://github.com/ivsg-psu/PathPlanning_PathTools_PathClassLibrary
% 
% Each should be installed in a folder called "Utilities" under the root
% folder, namely ./Utilities/DebugTools/ , ./Utilities/PathClassLibrary/ .
% If you wish to put these codes in different directories, the function
% below can be easily modified with strings specifying the different
% location.
% 
% For ease of transfer, zip files of the directories used - without the
% .git repo information, to keep them small - are included in this repo.
% 
% The following code checks to see if the folders flag has been
% initialized, and if not, it calls the DebugTools function that loads the
% path variables. It then loads the PathClassLibrary functions as well.
% Note that the PathClass Library also has sub-utilities that are included.
if ~exist('flag_Laps_Folders_Initialized','var')
    
    % add necessary directories for function creation utility 
    %(special case because folders not added yet)
    debug_utility_folder = fullfile(pwd, 'Utilities', 'DebugTools');
    debug_utility_function_folder = fullfile(pwd, 'Utilities', 'DebugTools','Functions');
    debug_utility_folder_inclusion_script = fullfile(pwd, 'Utilities', 'DebugTools','Functions','fcn_DebugTools_addSubdirectoriesToPath.m');
    if(exist(debug_utility_folder_inclusion_script,'file'))
        current_location = pwd;
        cd(debug_utility_function_folder);
        fcn_DebugTools_addSubdirectoriesToPath(debug_utility_folder,{'Functions','Data'});
        cd(current_location);
    else % Throw an error?
        error('The necessary utilities are not found. Please add them (see README.md) and run again.');
    end
    
    % Now can add the Path Class Library automatically
    utility_folder_PathClassLibrary = fullfile(pwd, 'Utilities', 'PathClassLibrary');
    fcn_DebugTools_addSubdirectoriesToPath(utility_folder_PathClassLibrary,{'Functions','Utilities'});
    
    % utility_folder_GetUserInputPath = fullfile(pwd, 'Utilities', 'GetUserInputPath');
    % fcn_DebugTools_addSubdirectoriesToPath(utility_folder_GetUserInputPath,{'Functions','Utilities'});

    % Now can add all the other utilities automatically
    folder_LapsClassLibrary = fullfile(pwd);
    fcn_DebugTools_addSubdirectoriesToPath(folder_LapsClassLibrary,{'Functions'});

    % set a flag so we do not have to do this again
    flag_Laps_Folders_Initialized = 1;
end

%% Using Zone Definitions to Define Start, End, and Excursion Locations
% To define the start, end, and excursion locations for data, the data must
% pass through or nearby a geolocation which is hereafter called a "zone
% definition". There are two types of zone definitions used in this code:
%%
% 
% * Point methods of zone definitions - this is when a start, stop, or
% excursion is defined by "passing by" a point. For example, if a journey
% is said to start at someone's house and go to someone's office, then the
% location of the house and office define the start and end of the journey.
% The specification is given by an X,Y location and a radius in the form of
% [X Y radius], as a 3x1 matrix. Whenever the path passes within the radius
% with a specified number of points within that radius, the minimum
% distance point then "triggers" the zone.
% * Line segment methods of zone definitions - this when a start, stop, or
% excursion condition is defined by a path passing through a line segment.
% The line segment is given by the X,Y coordinates of the start and stop of
% the line segment, in the form [Xstart Ystart; Xend Yend], thus producing
% a 2x2 matrix. An example of a line segment definition is the start line
% and finish line of a race.
% 
% To illustrate both definitions, we first create some data to plot:

full_steps = (-1:0.1:1)';
zero_full_steps = 0*full_steps; %#ok<NASGU>
ones_full_steps = ones(length(full_steps(:,1)),1);
half_steps = (-1:0.1:0)';
zero_half_steps = 0*half_steps;
ones_half_steps = ones(length(half_steps(:,1)),1); %#ok<PREALL>
path_examples{1} = [-1*ones_full_steps full_steps];
path_examples{2} = [1*ones_full_steps full_steps];

%% 
% Each of the path_example matrices above can be plotted easily using the
% "plotLapsXY" subfunction, but this function expects the paths to be in a
% traversal type so that it is compatible with the Path library of
% functions. To convert them, we use the conversion utility from the Path
% library, convert each to "traversal" types stored in a variable called
% path_data. We then plot the paths.

clear path_data
for i_Path = 1:length(path_examples)
    traversal = fcn_Path_convertPathToTraversalStructure(path_examples{i_Path});
    path_data.traversal{i_Path} = traversal;
end

% Plot the results via fcn_Laps_plotLapsXY
fig_num = 222;
fcn_Laps_plotLapsXY(path_data,fig_num);    

%%
% Now, use a zone plotting tool to show the point and line-segment types of
% zone definitions. The point definition is shown in green, and the segment
% definition is shown in blue. The segment definition includes an arrow
% that points in the direction of an allowable crossing.

fig_num = 444;

zone_center = [0.8 0];
zone_radius = 2;
num_points = 3;
point_zone_definition = [zone_radius num_points zone_center];
fcn_Laps_plotPointZoneDefinition(point_zone_definition,'g',fig_num);

segment_zone_definition = [0.8 0; 1.2 0];
fcn_Laps_plotSegmentZoneDefinition(segment_zone_definition,'b',fig_num);


%%
% Show we can get the same plot now via a combined function

fig_num = 4443;
fcn_Laps_plotZoneDefinition(point_zone_definition,'g',fig_num);
fcn_Laps_plotZoneDefinition(segment_zone_definition,'b',fig_num);

%% Point zone evaluations
% The function, fcn_Laps_findPointZoneStartStopAndMinimum, uses a point
% zone evaluation to determine portions of a segment that are within a
% point zone definition. For example, if the path does not cross into the
% zone, nothing is returned:
fig_num = 1;

query_path = ...
    [full_steps 0.4*ones_full_steps];

% path only crosses one or two points, then nothing is returned.
