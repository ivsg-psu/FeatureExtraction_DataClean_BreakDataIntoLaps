%% Introduction to and Purpose of the Code
% This is the explanation of the code that can be found by running
%       script_demo_Laps.m
% This is a script to demonstrate the functions within the Laps code
% library. This code repo is typically located at:
%   https://github.com/ivsg-psu/FeatureExtraction_DataClean_BreakDataIntoLaps
%
% If you have questions or comments, please contact Sean Brennan at
% sbrennan@psu.edu
%
% The purpose of the code is to break data into "laps", namely portions of
% data defined by start and end points, and in some cases, even allowing
% excursion points that must be "hit" between start and end points. The
% reason for this code is that it is very common that data collection in
% the field passes repeatedly over a test area, even in one data set, and
% thus one must be able to quickly break the code into individual data
% groups with one grouping, or "lap", per traversal.

disp('Welcome to the demo code for the Laps library!')

%% Using Zone Definitions to Define Start, End, and Excursion Locations
% To define the start, end, and excursion locations for data, the data must
% pass through or nearby a geolocation which is hereafter called a "zone
% definition". There are two types of zone definitions used in this code:
%%
%
% * Point methods of zone definitions - this is when a start, stop, or
% excursion is defined by "passing by" a point. For example, if a journey
% is said to start at someone's house and go to someone's office, then the
% location of the house and office define the start and end of the journey.
% The specification is given by an X,Y location and a radius in the form of
% [X Y radius], as a 3x1 matrix. Whenever the path passes within the radius
% with a specified number of points within that radius, the minimum
% distance point then "triggers" the zone.
% * Line segment methods of zone definitions - this when a start, stop, or
% excursion condition is defined by a path passing through a line segment.
% The line segment is given by the X,Y coordinates of the start and stop of
% the line segment, in the form [Xstart Ystart; Xend Yend], thus producing
% a 2x2 matrix. An example of a line segment definition is the start line
% and finish line of a race.
%
% To illustrate both definitions, we first create some data to plot:

full_steps = (-1:0.1:1)';
zero_full_steps = 0*full_steps; %#ok<NASGU>
ones_full_steps = ones(length(full_steps(:,1)),1);
half_steps = (-1:0.1:0)';
zero_half_steps = 0*half_steps;
ones_half_steps = ones(length(half_steps(:,1)),1); %#ok<PREALL>

path_examples = cell(2,1);
path_examples{1} = [-1*ones_full_steps full_steps];
path_examples{2} = [1*ones_full_steps full_steps];

% Each of the path_example matrices above can be plotted easily using the
% "plotLapsXY" subfunction

% Plot the results via fcn_Laps_plotLapsXY
figNum = 222;
fcn_Laps_plotLapsXY(path_examples,figNum);

%%
% Now, use a zone plotting tool to show the point and line-segment types of
% zone definitions. The point definition is shown in green, and the segment
% definition is shown in blue. The segment definition includes an arrow
% that points in the direction of an allowable crossing.

figNum = 444;

zone_center = [0.8 0];
zone_radius = 2;
num_points = 3;
point_zone_definition = [zone_radius num_points zone_center];
fcn_Laps_plotPointZoneDefinition(point_zone_definition,'g',figNum);

segment_zone_definition = [0.8 0; 1.2 0];
fcn_Laps_plotSegmentZoneDefinition(segment_zone_definition,'b',figNum);


%%
% Show we can get the same plot now via a combined function

figNum = 4443;
fcn_Laps_plotZoneDefinition(point_zone_definition,'g',figNum);
fcn_Laps_plotZoneDefinition(segment_zone_definition,'b',figNum);

%% Point zone evaluations
% The function, fcn_Laps_findPointZoneStartStopAndMinimum, uses a point
% zone evaluation to determine portions of a segment that are within a
% point zone definition. For example, if the path does not cross into the
% zone, nothing is returned:
figNum = 1;

query_path = ...
    [full_steps 0.4*ones_full_steps];

zone_center = [0 0 0.2]; % Located at [0,0]
zone_radius = 0.2; % with radius 0.2

    fcn_Laps_findPointZoneStartStopAndMinimum(...

    zone_radius,...
    [],...
    figNum);

assert(isempty(zone_start_indices));
assert(isempty(zone_end_indices));
assert(isempty(zone_min_indices));

%%
% And, the default is that three points must be within the zone. So, if a
% path only crosses one or two points, then nothing is returned.

figNum = 2;

query_path = ...
    [full_steps 0.2*ones_full_steps];

zone_center = [0 0 0.2]; % Located at [0,0]

% Show that 2 points still doesn't work
query_path = ...
