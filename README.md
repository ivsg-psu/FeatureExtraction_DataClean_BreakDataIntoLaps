# Errata_Tutorials_ReadmeTemplate
Last update:  2022-07-08 by S. Brennan

This readme is based on the IVSG README template in the repository: Errata_Tutorials_ReadmeTemplate. The goal of a readme is to guide users by providing information on how to get started, installations, Help and other information about your project. In IVSG, we typically edit markdown files (such as README.md) in Visual Code Studio (vscode) because it allows preview of the markdown. To see the preview in vscode, you can right-click on the editor Tab and select Open Preview (Ctrl+Shift+V) or use the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) to run the Markdown: Open Preview to the Side command (Ctrl+K V). In general, opening the preview to the side is easier to edit (Ctrl+K V).

## Description

There are several methods to create README files, but it is recommended that you use the template provided in the documents folder to ensure uniformity between different repositories used by the IVSG.

Your description should explain concisely - in one paragraph - the reasons for the code: what does it do? why was it written? who wrote it? how is it typically used? when was it last updated? what are the major releases?

For lengthy explanations of code, or for code that requires many pages and/or sub-pages, use the wiki feature and link to it here at the bottom of the description.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Code editor such as notepad, notepad++, Visual Studio, etc. Within our team, we suggest using Visual Code Studio (also called vscode) because it is available and installed on all our computers.

* Dependencies should be listed in name, why it is a dependency, showing links, with a bullet for each dependency. For example, see the next bullet:

* [Errata_Tutorials_ReadmeTemplate](https://github.com/ivsg-psu/Errata_Tutorials_ReadmeTemplate) - This repo contains an example of the README template. See: https://github.com/ivsg-psu/Errata_Tutorials_ReadmeTemplate

### Installing

* The install instructios area should note:

1. what type and version of software is needed? (MATLAB 2021a, ROS Kinetic, Ubuntu 20.04LTS, Windows 11?)
2. what file to read first?
3. what code to execute first?
4. how does one know that the installation worked after unning the code?

* Download the README file present in the documents folder
* the file can be edited using an IDE like Visual studio code or even notepad


### Executing program
* This area should explain how to run the code. Again, what code to run first? Where are key files located? What is the suggested order of running files?
* Change the content under the sub-headings as needed by your project
* Add, commit, and push the new README file named "README.md" to your desired repository
